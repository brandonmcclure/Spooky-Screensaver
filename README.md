# Spooky-Screensaver

I wanted a screensaver for Halloween that will display spiders and other creepy crawly/spooky things moving around my screen. So far, I have a screen saver that will display a adorable little spider as it rather robotically meanders across my screen. I mess around from time to time to add other features, and maybe one day my desktop will have a scary torantuala crawling around it!
